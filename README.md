# Tauri + Nuxt 3 Template

This is a minimal template to combine Tauri and Nuxt 3.

This template is constructed completely with official template from Tauri and Nuxt 3.

Tauri API has been verified to work with Nuxt, just make sure `ssr` is `false` in [nuxt.config.ts](./nuxt.config.ts). 

The code used to verify tauri API has been removed to keep the template as clean as possible. `@tauri-apps/api` has been installed though.
